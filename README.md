Learn how to Perform Basic Decision Tree techniques on data
A decision tree is a type of supervised learning algorithm that is used for both classification and regression tasks. It works by creating a tree-like model of decisions and their possible outcomes. Each internal node of the tree represents a test of an attribute, each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label or a value. By following the branches in the tree from the root node to a leaf node, a prediction can be made. Decision trees are simple to understand, interpret, and visualize and are often used in data mining, machine learning, and data analysis.
